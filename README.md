It looks like you'd like to adjust the flow of your app so that the **Wallets** section isn't accessible until a **Mnemonic** has been generated or entered. Below, I’ve updated the **README.md** to reflect this requirement, explaining the flow of the app from **Generate Mnemonic** to **View Wallets** in a more step-by-step approach.

# Custom Web Wallet

This **Web Wallet** app is built with **React** and allows users to manage Solana and Ethereum wallets by generating or entering a **Mnemonic Phrase**. Users can then view wallet balances for both Solana and Ethereum, but access to the wallet-related functionality is restricted until a **Mnemonic** is created or entered.

## Features

- **Generate Mnemonic**: Generate a new mnemonic phrase for creating a wallet.
- **Enter Mnemonic**: Enter an existing mnemonic to recover or restore a wallet.
- **Wallets**: View wallet addresses for both **Solana** and **Ethereum**, along with their balances.
- **Blockchain Balances**: Fetch and display wallet balances for both Solana and Ethereum blockchains.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## App Flow

1. **Home**: The dashboard where you can start interacting with the app.
2. **Generate Mnemonic**: Click this option to generate a new mnemonic phrase. This is the first step in creating your wallet.
3. **Enter Mnemonic**: If you already have a mnemonic (from a previous wallet), you can enter it here to restore your wallet.
4. **Wallets**: Once you have generated or entered a mnemonic, you can navigate to the **Wallets** section to view wallet details (Solana and Ethereum) and their balances.

### Wallet Access Restrictions

- The **Wallets** section will not be accessible until a **Mnemonic** is generated or entered. This is a safeguard to ensure the user has a valid mnemonic before attempting to interact with blockchain wallets.
- If you try to access **Wallets** without a mnemonic, the app will guide you to first generate or enter one.

## Project Structure

- **App.jsx**: Main component that handles routing and page transitions.
- **Mnemonic.jsx**: Component for generating a new mnemonic phrase.
- **UserMemonics.jsx**: Component for entering an existing mnemonic to recover a wallet.
- **Seed.jsx**: Component that derives a seed from the mnemonic.
- **Solana.jsx**: Component to interact with the Solana blockchain using the seed.
- **Ether.jsx**: Component to interact with the Ethereum blockchain using the seed.
- **SolanaBalance.jsx**: Component to display the Solana wallet balance.
- **EtherBalance.jsx**: Component to display the Ethereum wallet balance.
- **Home.jsx**: Dashboard or landing page that provides an overview of the app.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/senthan-07/McProj2.git"
cd McProj2
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Start the app

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The Web Wallet app will be up and running.

### 4. Using the Web Wallet

#### Step 1: **Home** (Dashboard)
Create mnemonic create wallet wont work so click create mnemoninc and right navbar components

#### Step 2: **Generate Mnemonic**

Click on the **Generate Mnemonic** link in the navigation bar. This is where you’ll generate a new mnemonic phrase. The mnemonic will be shown, and you’ll need to store it securely as it’s critical for wallet recovery.

#### Step 3: **Enter Mnemonic**

If you already have a mnemonic from another wallet or previous session, you can click on the **Enter Mnemonic** link. This allows you to input your existing mnemonic phrase, which will restore your wallet.

#### Step 4: **Wallets**

After generating or entering a mnemonic, you can now visit the **Wallets** section. Here’s what happens:
- The app will use your mnemonic to derive a **seed**.
- Using the seed, it will generate wallet addresses for both **Solana** and **Ethereum**.
- The wallets will also display the **Solana** and **Ethereum** balances by querying their respective blockchains.

You will not be able to access the **Wallets** page until a mnemonic is available, ensuring you have a valid recovery phrase before interacting with the wallet features.

### 5. Wallet Functionality

- **Solana and Ethereum Wallets**: After generating or entering a mnemonic, the app will display wallet addresses for both the Solana and Ethereum blockchains.
- **Solana Balance**: Fetches the balance of the generated or restored Solana wallet.
- **Ethereum Balance**: Fetches the balance of the generated or restored Ethereum wallet.
  
The balance will update based on the wallet addresses derived from your mnemonic.

## Component Overview

### `App.jsx`

- Sets up **React Router** to navigate between different pages (home, generate mnemonic, enter mnemonic, wallets).
- Manages state using **React hooks** like `useState` for mnemonic and seed.

### `Mnemonic.jsx`

- Generates a new **BIP-39** mnemonic phrase using a secure random generator.
- Provides the mnemonic to the user, who should store it securely.

### `UserMemonics.jsx`

- Allows the user to enter an existing mnemonic to restore or recover a wallet.
- Validates and converts the mnemonic to a seed.

### `Seed.jsx`

- Converts the mnemonic into a **seed** using **BIP-32** to derive wallet keys and addresses.

### `Solana.jsx`

- Uses the derived seed to generate a **Solana wallet**.
- Fetches wallet details like the Solana wallet address.

### `Ether.jsx`

- Uses the derived seed to generate an **Ethereum wallet**.
- Allows interaction with Ethereum using **ethers.js**.

### `SolanaBalance.jsx`

- Queries the Solana blockchain for the balance of the derived wallet address.

### `EtherBalance.jsx`

- Queries the Ethereum blockchain for the balance of the derived wallet address.

### `Home.jsx`

- Displays a simple dashboard and navigation links to the other components.

## Libraries and Tools

- **React**: Frontend JavaScript library for building UI components.
- **React Router**: Manages routing and navigation between different pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **ethers.js**: Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **@solana/web3.js**: Official library to interact with the Solana blockchain.
- **Bip39**: For generating and validating mnemonic phrases.

## Security Considerations

- **Mnemonic Security**: Mnemonics are sensitive data, and they are used to regenerate wallet keys. Store your mnemonic phrase securely. Never share it with anyone.
- **App Security**: This app does not handle mnemonic storage securely. It's recommended to use hardware wallets or secure environments to store mnemonics for production use.

This **README** now emphasizes the **Mnemonic Creation** step and the restriction of wallet access until the mnemonic is generated or entered. This ensures a clear, secure, and guided flow through the app for users.
