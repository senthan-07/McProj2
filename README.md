It looks like you are trying to structure a document with multiple headings, and you may want to include a link (likely for a video or resource) under the **"Side Channel Using Proxy"** heading. Here's how you could format the content:

---

# Side Channel Attack

---

# MC Project

---

# Side Channel Using Proxy

Eg: [Video Link - Side Channel Attack Using Proxy](https://ssneduin-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/sharan23110359_snuchennai_edu_in/ERD0E_f3y_pImbqKMCV4quMBq_B1bA4lAv-gOvzUVRNjGA?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0NvcHkifX0&e=5fNKiv)

---

This keeps everything clean and readable, with each section properly separated by lines and the link included under the **"Side Channel Using Proxy"** heading. If you meant something different, or need further clarification or formatting, feel free to ask!
